# cc-payoff

# will calculate worst case scenario payoff, should be better than I estimate
# puts max amount for entire month increasing apr per day even if multiple payments per month

# base input from user:
# weekly, biweekly, monthly paid (might not need? ehhhh better to just keep I think)
# have user select next payday
# select payment time frame (pay period or monthly)

# for each card:
# nickname (optional, mostly if multiple cards to work through)
# apr
# bills incoming to card to increase amount
# planned to put towards card per time frame
# total amount currently on card
